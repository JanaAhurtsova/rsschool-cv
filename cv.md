## **About Myself:**
I’d describe myself as a goal-oriented, self-motivated and hardworking person with good organizational skills and strategic thinking. 
In my previous jobs that were not related to front-end development I've developed a number of important skills, including decision-making, problem-solving skills and multitasking.
Now I'm ready to continue developing, studying something new and improving my skills.
